Your Theory of Politics is Wrong

"It is not that I am for Bernie Sanders, but that Bernie Sanders is for me. Bernie Sanders, more than any politician who has ever had a serious shot at the office of United States President, represents my interests and values. By that I don’t mean my interests in a narrow, self-interested sense, but in his vision for what kind of country my country can and should be."

Here's the political science behind the Trump and Sanders revolts

"The lesson for the Democrats is that, while Bernie Sanders may not be their nominee, it's ridiculous to argue he's too left-wing to be electable. There's a reason Sanders actually beats Trump and Cruz by bigger margins than Clinton in head-to-head polling matchups, and why he's been cleaning up among lower-income Americans. Beyond that, this isn't about any one candidate: there's an opening here for a left-populist economic movement sustained well beyond Sanders' campaign."

Hillary’s inevitability lie: Why the media and party elites are rushing to nominate the weakest candidate
For two years, media has swallowed and peddled the Clinton inevitability line. She's the one Dem even Trump beats

"If Clinton and Trump win their conventions, it’ll be the first time both parties nominated their weakest candidate. Trump is the one Republican almost any Democrat can beat; Hillary the one Democrat Trump can beat. The response of the party establishments is instructive. Republicans engage in a mad scramble to stop Trump while Democrats do all they can to help Hillary seal the deal."

Educate, Agitate, Organize - The Left’s engagement with the Sanders campaign is about more than one nomination in a rotten and compromised party.

 "[W]hat we are trying to do is much more than win a nomination in a party that is rotten and compromised. We’re trying agitate the citizenry: not to tell people their interests (which they usually know) but to persuade them that if they act collectively, they can get those interests, which is something most people don’t know. No matter what happens, we’ve already begun that work."

The Case Against Hillary Clinton
"Clinton would surely be better than whatever crawls out of the Republican primary swamp, her presidency would be a step back for the nation as a whole."

1. Clinton is far too aggressive with the use of military force. 
- As a senator, she voted for the war in Iraq; 
- As Secretary of State, she supported escalation in Afghanistan, pushed hard for the Libyan intervention, and lobbied for a continued military presence in Iraq;

2. The whole Clinton operation is extremely shady. 
- Clinton has raised millions in campaign contributions from all sorts of rich industries, particularly Wall Street;
- The still ongoing email scandal is still another example of a classic Clinton behavior: extreme secrecy and paranoia. She despises the press.

3. General Clinton ideology. 
- The Clintons were at the forefront of the turn towards neoliberalism in the Democratic Party, the most disastrous of which was the evisceration of traditional welfare in 1996, which increased extreme poverty in this country by 150 percent
- Clinton has a long history of being pro-deregulation, anti-labor (she spent six years on the board of viciously anti-union Walmart, and did not defend worker organizing once), and advocating for draconian anti-crime policy.
