    <h1>Hey WA, Let's Caucus!</h1>

    When you head to your neighborhood caucus spot to chat with your neighbors,
    consider some of these talking points that set Bernie apart from HRC.

    <h1>Foreign Policy</h1>

    <p>
      "Between war and passivity, there are a thousand possibilities" --Howard Zinn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bernie and Hillary differ on the appropriate use of force internationally, and
      your fellow caucus-goers may be surprised to hear how far right Hillary stands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">Project
      for a New American Century</a>?  No?  Click the link and check it out.
      These are the guys that wrote the blueprint for the Iraq war.  10 of the 25 signers of the PNAC
      founding statement served in the Bush/Cheney administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the two founders of the PNAC is a guy named
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kagan">Robert Kagan</a>.

      In the 80s Kagan worked in the State Department under Reagan.  In 2008 he was the foreign policy
      advisor to John McCain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guess what he did after McCain lost?  Hillary hired him to work for the State Department.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently Kagan has returned the favor,
      urging conservatives to support Hillary over Trump: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-is-the-gops-frankenstein-monster-now-hes-strong-enough-to-destroy-the-party/2016/02/25/3e443f28-dbc1-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html">"For this former Republican...the only choice will be to vote for Hillary Clinton."</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Kagan isn't the only neocon to back Hillary. The list includes
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_A._Cohen">Eliot Cohen (served under Condoleezza Rice)</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Perle">Richard Perle</a>
      and Noemie Emery <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/18998/neocon-war-hawks-want-hillary-clinton-over-donald-trump.-no-surprisetheyve">as reported by Branko Mercetic</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bottom line: Supporting HRC means supporting the same policy advisors that brought you the Iraq War in 2003.
    </p>

    <p>
      For contrast, <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/614512/how-bernie-sanders-got-foreign-policy-groove-back">read Ryan Cooper's article on Sanders</a> that summarizes how a Sanders
      administration would deal with foreign policy and military intervention.
    </p>

    <h1>Electability</h1>

    <p>
      Bernie taps into the political unrest sweeping the country while Hillary does not.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/609861/heres-political-science-behind-trump-sanders-revolts">Here's the
        political science behind the Trump and Sanders revolts</a>

      "The lesson for the Democrats is that, while Bernie Sanders may not be their nominee, it's ridiculous to argue he's
      too left-wing to be electable. There's a reason Sanders actually beats Trump and Cruz by bigger margins than Clinton
      in head-to-head polling matchups, and why he's been cleaning up among lower-income Americans. Beyond that, this
      isn't about any one candidate: there's an opening here for a left-populist economic movement sustained well
      beyond Sanders' campaign."
    </p>

    <p>
      Hillary is also strongly disliked by the broad electorate.
    </p>

    <p>
      As CBS News reports this week <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-viewed-unfavorably-by-majority-cbsnyt-poll/">Hillary has a net negative rating of -21%</a> among the general electorate.  Only Trump polls worse,
      and if the GOP figures out a way to block him, the Democrats will lose the general election.
    </p>

    <p>
      This same article notes that <b>Sanders beats Trump by 15%</b> in a general election.
    </p>

    <h1>October Surprise</h1>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/us/politics/as-presidential-campaign-unfolds-so-do-inquiries-into-hillary-clintons-emails.html?_r=0">The NYT reports that the investigation will conclude in May, with possible indictments made at this time.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Why should Democrats risk nominating a candidate that is under FBI investigation and could be fighting
      an indictment during the general election?
